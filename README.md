# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

This game is an interactive version of the traditional Simon Electronic Memory Game.

## Game Rules

- There are 4 distinct colour boxes (Green, Red, Yellow, Blue), and clicking each one will play a different sound.
- When you press "A ", the game will start and the boxes begin to become highlighted and randomly plays corresponding sound.
- The player then has to copy that particular sequence by manually clicking the boxes.
- If all boxes were clicked in correct sequence, the player will enter next level and have a more complex set of challenge as the game progresses to higher levels.
- Once the sequence breaks, the player will lose the game. Enjoy playingðŸ¥³
